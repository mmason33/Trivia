# Trivia Game

A Who Wants to be a Millionaire themed Trivia Game. ~~The game is one JavaScript Object~~. The game is a JavaScript Class. I utilize jQuery to manipulate the DOM simply because of the simplicity and functionality.

## ToDo

1. ~~Implement the Open Trivia API to populate questions dynamically~~
2. ~~Refactor to a Class~~
3. ~~Implement ES6 syntax within that Class~~
